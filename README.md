# AGU-2023-Joseph-Nied-Poster
GitHub repository for online/virtual results for Joseph Nied's poster at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2023, titled "Advancing Global Cloud Detection in Satellite Imagery with Spatial and Spectral Awareness via Deep Learning". Within this repository, you can view both the AGU Poster and online only results that display animations of our best models learning cloud textures and features within satellite remote sensing imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR).
